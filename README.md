# Coexecutor Runtime

The oneAPI Coexecutor Runtime will be officially released in the next months, including examples of use, benchmarks and main core parts. 

The main author is at the end of the PhD, thus, the code will be open sourced after he finishes his main tasks related to the completion of the doctorate (Jan. 2022).

The PDF document contains some API examples and experiments performed at the end of 2020 - beginning of 2021. The latest information and validations can be seen in the published papers.

## Research

Coexecutor Runtime is currently being used and validated in specialized architectures, such as FPGAs, by other research groups like the Department of Computing and Systems Engineering, from University of Zaragoza (UNIZAR). 

You can find more information about the runtime in the following publications.
